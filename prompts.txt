# NexusCRM - Development Prompts

## Code Generation Prompts

### Component Creation
"Create a new React component for [feature] following the existing codebase patterns. Use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, and ensure it integrates with the ThemeContext for dark mode support."

"Generate a reusable form component for [purpose] that matches the design system used in the settings pages, with proper validation and error handling."

"Create a modal/dialog component that follows the existing UI patterns in the codebase, with support for dark mode and responsive design."

### Feature Development
"Add a new feature to [page] that allows users to [action]. Follow the existing API patterns in services/api.ts and integrate with Supabase for data persistence."

"Implement a new filter option in the contacts page that filters by [criteria]. Ensure it works with the existing server-side pagination and sorting."

"Create a new dashboard widget that displays [metric] using Recharts, following the patterns in the dashboard page."

### API Integration
"Add a new API endpoint integration in services/api.ts that fetches [data] from the Appointment360 API, following the existing contact fetching patterns with proper error handling and type mapping."

"Create a Supabase service function that [action] following the patterns in services/supabase.ts, with proper TypeScript types and error handling."

### Authentication & Authorization
"Add role-based access control to [page/feature] that checks user roles stored in Supabase and restricts access accordingly."

"Implement a new authentication method [method] following the existing Supabase auth patterns in contexts/AuthContext.tsx."

### UI/UX Improvements
"Improve the responsive design of [component/page] for mobile devices, ensuring it follows the mobile-first approach used in the codebase."

"Add loading states and error boundaries to [page] following the patterns used in other pages, with proper user feedback."

"Implement optimistic updates for [feature] to improve perceived performance, with proper error rollback handling."

### TypeScript & Type Safety
"Add TypeScript types for [data structure] in types/index.ts, ensuring they match the API response structure and are used consistently across the codebase."

"Refactor [component] to use proper TypeScript types and remove any 'any' types, following the existing type patterns."

### Testing & Debugging
"Add error logging and monitoring to [feature] to help debug production issues, following the existing error handling patterns."

"Create a debug utility that helps log API requests and responses for [service] during development."

### Code Refactoring
"Refactor [component] to extract reusable logic into a custom hook, following the patterns in hooks/useAuth.ts and hooks/useTheme.ts."

"Optimize [page] for performance by implementing proper memoization and reducing unnecessary re-renders, following React best practices."

### Documentation
"Add JSDoc comments to [function/component] explaining its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples."

"Create inline documentation for [complex logic] explaining the business rules and implementation details."

## AI Assistant Prompts (for Gemini integration)

"Explain how the AI assistant feature works in this codebase, including how it integrates with Google Gemini API and the function calling mechanism for contact search."

"Add a new AI function capability that allows users to [action] through natural language, following the existing searchContacts function pattern."

"How does the AI assistant maintain conversation context and save chat history to Supabase?"

## Architecture & Design Questions

"Explain the authentication flow in this application, from user registration through protected routes."

"How does the theme switching work? Walk through the ThemeContext implementation and how it persists across page reloads."

"Describe how server-side pagination is implemented in the contacts page and how it integrates with filtering and sorting."

"What is the data flow for fetching contacts? Trace from the UI component through the API service to the external Appointment360 API."

"How are environment variables configured in this Next.js application? Explain the difference between NEXT_PUBLIC_ and regular env vars."

"What is the folder structure pattern for this Next.js app? Explain the route groups (auth) and (dashboard) and how they work."

"How does the settings page handle multiple tabs and sub-routes? Explain the routing structure."

## Troubleshooting Prompts

"Debug why [component] is not rendering correctly in dark mode. Check ThemeContext integration and Tailwind classes."

"Investigate why API calls are failing. Check environment variables, API endpoint configuration, and CORS settings."

"Fix the layout issue on [page] where [problem]. Ensure responsive design patterns are followed."

"Why is the Supabase authentication not working? Check the AuthContext implementation and Supabase configuration."

## Migration & Upgrade Prompts

"Upgrade Next.js to the latest version while maintaining compatibility with existing code and dependencies."

"Migrate [feature] from client-side state to server-side state using Next.js Server Components, if applicable."

"Add TypeScript strict mode to the project and fix all resulting type errors."
